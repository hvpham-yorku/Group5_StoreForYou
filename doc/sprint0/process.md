**Process**  
The cohesion of a team is imperative to the workflow, team environment, and the quality of deliverables produced. We recognise that the ability to come to a consensus is a significant deciding factor in the outcome of the project, and have taken the necessary steps to make this process as smooth as possible.

*Team Organisation*  
The team primarily communicates through the Discord server to facilitate prompt response times. As a contingency, we have each other's emails on file to detail any major communications.  
Following the requirements of the project, all members are a part of the Git Classroom provided by the professor and have created a private repository under the name “Group5\_StoreForYou” to push the final versions of our submission. 

To maintain collaborative efforts, we work on our documents through a Google Docs file with organised tabs maintaining all deliverables. Upon confirmation from the team that our respective works are approved, we push the document in the needed format onto our Git repository.

We also have a Trello workspace and board, as requested by the project outline. 

*Decision-Making and Prioritisation*  
While decision-making was primarily conducted through discussion, we have also facilitated voting to decide what to implement for this project. 

When it came to deciding what we should implement, anyone with an idea contributed to the brainstorming, and the final list of ideas was voted on by everyone. This resulted in one round of voting, concluding with the decision to implement an e-commerce site.   
Similarly, one group member took the lead in brainstorming some names for the project, and another member suggested a name that fit within the criteria we were looking to match.   
This did not require voting, as everyone unanimously agreed that the suggested name was the best option. 

After addressing the main features and goals, we split up deliverables and decided to ask for assistance as needed, and peer review after completion. In the future, we will schedule Discord and Zoom meetings to discuss our progress, address concerns, and make adjustments. The meetings will be led by the members on a rotating basis, with meeting minutes being recorded for documentation. The date for these meetings will be agreed upon by deciding a time that works best for everyone, or at the least, a majority of the team.

*Conclusion*  
Our current method of discussion, followed by voting as necessary has worked seamlessly thus far. We have been able to stay on the same page about our expectations and understand the goals of the project.   
Moving forward, we aim to maintain the consistency of our discussions and facilitate organised meetings to document our progress and update each other. By conducting these measures appropriately, we aim to ensure the project maintains cohesiveness despite the delegation and separation of tasks.
