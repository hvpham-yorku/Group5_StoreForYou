E-COMMERCE PLATFORM PROJECT SUMMARY

Objective:
The goal of this project is to develop a modular, scalable e-commerce platform that usitizes microservices. This platform will enable users to browse, purchase, and manage products. This will be accomplished by separating the application into independent services. Our aim is to create a flexible system that can accommodate future enhancements. The platform will focus on providing a seamless shopping experience, clean inventory management, and a secure payment processing system. 

Key Users:
Shoppers (End User): Shoppers are people who browse and purchase products on our platform. They are looking for a user-friendly and intuitive interface. They are looking for features like product recommendations, efficient and secure checkout process, and wishlists.

Admin Users: Staff or moderators responsible for managing products, inventory, and processing orders. They require a dashboard to monitor orders, track inventory, and manage product listing. 

Guest Users: Visitors who browse products and do not have an account. They should still be able to access products and make carts, but will be required to make an account if they wish to place an order. 

Key Use Cases: 
Product Browsing: Users can browse products by category, filter by price, or search specific items. Each product has a detailed dedicated page with images, descriptions, ratings, and reviews. 

Shopping Cart Management: Users can add products to their carts, update quantities, and save items to a wishlist for future purchases. 

Checkout and Payment: 
Users can proceed to checkout, choose shipping options, and select a payment method. Secure payment processing through a trusted payment gateway with confirmation and order summary will also be implemented. 

Order Management (Admin User Case): Admins can view and manage incoming orders, update statuses, and handle refunds or cancel orders. 

Inventory Management (Admin User Case): Admins can add new products, update descriptions and images, and manage inventory levels to prevent overstocking and overselling. Low-stock alerts will be implemented to ensure products are restocked in a timely manner. 

Key Usage Scenarios: 
End-to-end Shopping experience: A shopper visits the platform and searches for a product. They add it to their cart and complete a purchase using their preferred payment method. They will then receive a confirmation and can track the status of their order through their account. 

Admin Inventory Update: An admin logs into the dashboard and reviews the low-stock alerts and updates product details or inventory levels as needed. They check incoming orders and ensure accurate stock management. 

A guest user visits the platform and browses products then adds items to their cart. To complete the purchase, the user is prompted to create an account which will allow them to convert from a guest to a registered user. They are then redirected back to the checkout page to place their order. 

Key Principles
Customer Satisfaction over Operational Ease
The design should prioritize enhancing the customer shopping experience, even if it adds complexity to backend operations. By focusing on customer satisfaction, weâ€™re more likely to improve retention, attract repeat buyers, and create positive brand perception, which is especially crucial in e-commerce where user experience can make a significant difference.

Ease of Use over Feature Richness
The design should focus on a simple and intuitive shopping flow. Instead of adding multiple features, prioritize those that make the browsing, searching, and purchasing processes effortless, which can result in higher satisfaction and fewer cart abandonments.
