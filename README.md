# StoreForYou

An e-commerce platform that vends a specialised selection of personalised products implemented by Node.js and React. The site aims to make product personalisation user-friendly while maintaining quality.

## Installation

Use the prebuilt installer for [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/prebuilt-installer) or visit their site to choose another installation method.

To check if the installation was completed correctly, open your command line tool and type `node -v`

Since we’re using React, we also want to ensure NPM was installed correctly. Type into your command line tool: `npm -v`

Both commands should print the program’s respective version numbers.
